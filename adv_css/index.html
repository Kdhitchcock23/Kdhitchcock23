    <h1>Food Choices</h1>
    <p>What is it that keeps so many of us bellying up for double-decker burgers, dipping repeatedly and obsessively into bags of crunchy chips, and chasing it all down with super-sweet soda?
        These so-called junk foods hit us right where our taste buds live and also satisfy a love of sugar that we are born with. But the burgeoning, and in some cases, chronic, consumption of junk is driven by peer pressure and marketing—not
         physiological need—say nutrition experts. People love the way they taste. McDonalds for example recently has gone on the offensive, aiming, it says, to correct misperceptions about what is in its food and to meet consumer demand 
         for more nutrition information.

            <h2>Why do we love unhealthy foods?</h2> 

            <p> Well,You just cant seem to give it up and keep eating, especially during times of heavy stress. And there is certainly been plenty of stress to keep us hitting the bags of 
                chocolate the last several months. Especially when we are stressed, junk food often soothes us with the least amount of fuss and effort. We look for sugary and fatty foods to make us feel good,”
                says registered dietitian Beth Czerwony, RD. There are ways to get control of your food cravings, instead of them controlling you. Junk food is food that is unhealthy for you, just as the word “junk” implies.

            <h3>Unhealthy food habits</h3> 
            <p>According to a 2012 Food and Health Survey, only 3 in 10 Americans believe that all sources of calories play an equal role in weight gain. Many Americans believe that carbohydrates, sugars, and fats are the key 
                sources for weight gain. Americans consume 31% more packaged food than fresh food. Healthiness of the food we eat decreases by 1.7% for every hour that passes in the day, meaning that people generally eat healthiest 
                at breakfast and will most likely eat unhealthier food later in the day.Over 10 billion donuts are consumed in the US every year. Americans spend 10% of their disposable income on fast food every year.

            <h4>How to make heathly food choices </h4> 
            <p> It's important to understand the nutritional value of the food you are buying. You can do this by reading the nutrition panel found on the back of all packaged items. Food labels can tell you things like the amount of 
                energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, sugars, fibre and sodium (salt) in each product, as well as the recommended serving size.When checking a product for its nutritional value, make sure you look at the health claims such as 'low in fat' or 'sugar free', as these can be misleading. 
                When a product is advertised as 'light' or 'lite', this may refer only to the product's colour or flavour. This means that the product may still be 'full-fat' — be sure to read the nutrition information panel at the back of the package for the actual fat content.
