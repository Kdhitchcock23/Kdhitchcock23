    <h3> What is Makeup? </h3>
    <p>When you think of the word "makeup" what exaclty comes to mind? For me it is creativity! Makeup has been around for thousands of years. 
        Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians first explored the beauty of what it brings which then carries down to the middle ages. Makeup is also known as Cosmetics.
         With the creation of makeup it takes roughly around 30 minutes to an hour to complete using chemical compounds needed from natural
        sources to create makeup. Makeup can be used in many ways. It can used as everyday personal care, actors for stage or movie performances, and special effects. 
        After the makeup product is finished it is placed in an eye-catching material such as eyeshadow pallets,jars for setting powders,liptick holders, and the list goes 
        on!</p>
